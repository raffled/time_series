## time_series
Unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to take a time series analysis
course in grad school.

This repository contains some work following allong with Shumway & Stoffer's
*Time Series Analysis and Its Application with R Examples* (Springer).

For more info (and a free download of the text), see the authors' site at [http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa3/](http://www.stat.pitt.edu/stoffer/tsa3/).  The pdf in this repo comes from there, with their license.
